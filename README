Keyboard Shortcut List

F2: Toggle auto-indent. When auto-indent has been toggled off by pressing F2,
    "(paste)" will be displayed in Vim's command line to show that your Vim
    environment is now in PASTE mode. This allows you to paste content into
    Vim without auto-indent messing it up.

F5: Enable Vim to listen for Xdebug connection. You have 10 seconds to hit
    your project in the browser with "?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1" appened to
    the end of the URL.
